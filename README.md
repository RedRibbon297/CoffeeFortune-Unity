The game "Coffee Fotrune" is a randomizer with an answer to the user's questions (like fortune telling on coffee grounds). 
The game was created solely for entertainment purposes, as well as for teaching the C# and Unity. 

The implementation of "Magic Ball" game is taken as a basis (link to the tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd89oksgJR8&t=10s&ab_channel=ICECREAM)
