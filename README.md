# CoffeeFortune-Unity
The game "Coffee Fotrune" is a randomizer with an answer to the user's questions (like fortune telling on coffee grounds).   
The game was created solely for entertainment purposes, as well as for teaching the C# and Unity.  

Unity version: 2022.3.10f1

The implementation of "Magic Ball" [game-tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd89oksgJR8&t=10s&ab_channel=ICECREAM) is taken as a basis. 

Not for commercial distribution.
